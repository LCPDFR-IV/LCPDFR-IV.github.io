# Downgrading

What version of **LCPDFR** should I use?

**Latest Complete Edition**:
- LCPDFR 1.1: Legacy Edition
- LCPDFR Compatability Patch

**1.0.8.0**:
- LCPDFR 1.1 Legacy Edition

**1.0.7.0**:
- LCPDFR 1.1: Non Legacy

## Why Downgrade?

In latest **Complete Edition**, additional scripts/plugins will **not** work for LCPDFR. You **must** downgrade to an older version of GTAIV to use additional scripts/plugins.

## How To Downgrade?

_You **must** own a legal copy of **GTAIV:CE**. Please make sure you complete this guide with a fresh/clean installation of **GTAIV:CE**._

1). Download & Extract [IVDowngrader](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/GTAIVDowngrader/releases/download/v2.1/IVDowngrader.v2.1.zip).
2). Run **IVDowngrader** as Administrator.
3). Next: Browse & Select `GTAIV/GTAIV.exe`.
4). Next: Ignore Warning.
5). Next: Select version 1.0.7.0 or 1.0.8.0. (_**LCPDFR = 1.0.7.0**_)
6). Next: Check (_Configure this downgrade for GFWL_).
7). Next: Next on **Product Key Information**.

??? note "Optional"

    Step 8 & 9 you can pick what you prefer, or can skip entirely.

8). Next: Select the **First Radio Downgrade**.
9). Next: Select **Old Vladivostok**.
10). Next: **Select Mods** (_Simple Traffic Loader, DSound, ZMenuIV, ZolikaPatch_)

The downgrade should start next. You’ll be prompted to install directx, vsredist, and GFWL. Process will take a few minutes afterwards.

??? warn "Games For Windows Live"
    
    Do not “launch” GFWL marketplace after installation. It doesn’t work, though doesn't break the way GFWL works.

## Gamesaves

You’ll be asked to convert gamesaves. If you don’t have gamesaves, you may use [these](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1218706388998553771/1218715461860986970/saves.zip), or just skip converting/these steps.
- Start the game once and log into your microsoft (xbox) account.
- In the `Data/Savegames` folder of **IVDowngrader**, copy the save files and put them into your user folder(s) located in `%localappdata%\Rockstar Games\GTA IV\savegames\`
